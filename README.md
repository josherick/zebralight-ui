# Zebralight UI for Web

An implementation of the Zebralight UI for web, meant as a tutorial to help
users understand what actions are available at each stage.

Demo: https://josherick.github.io/zebralight-ui/

Some caveats:
- The implementation is based on the [latest version](https://zebralight.3dcartstores.com/assets/images/ZebraLightUserGuide2019.pdf) of the UI as of 2019.
- This implements a subset of the device functionality. Notably, it omits multiple UI groups. If you'd like to learn about those, you can read about them in the manual (linked above).
- The brightness levels are not proportional to the actual lumen levels â€“ differences between levels are exaggerated to make it easier to tell that the light is changing.
