# Zebralight UI for Web

An implementation of the Zebralight UI for web, meant as a tutorial to help
users understand what actions are available at each stage.

Demo: https://josherick.github.io/zebralight-ui/

Some caveats:
- The implementation is based on the [latest
  version](https://zebralight.3dcartstores.com/assets/images/ZebraLightUserGuide2019.pdf)
  of the UI as of 2019.
- This implements a subset of the device functionality. Notably, it omits
  multiple UI groups. If you'd like to learn about those, you can read about
  them in the manual (linked above).
- The brightness levels are not proportional to the actual lumen levels â€“
  differences between levels are exaggerated to make it easier to tell that the
  light is changing.
- The lumens and runtime values are based off [the
  604c](https://zebralight.3dcartstores.com/H604c-18650-XHP502-Flood-4000K-High-CRI-Headlamp_p_223.html).

# Implementation
This is implemented using a state machine with [234
states](https://github.com/josherick/zebralight-ui/blob/main/src/state_machine/implementations/basic_ui/enums.js#L105),
which were programatically generated. The states contain information about the
current lamp state (brightness, strobe, battery indicator) as well as a state
suffix which is used to keep track of information like whether the user is
cycling between levels, and how many times they've toggled between sublevels.

There is also
[memory](https://github.com/josherick/zebralight-ui/blob/main/src/state_machine/implementations/basic_ui/memory.js)
which stores the last used sublevel (i.e. H1 vs H2) and lumen level for
H2/M2/L2 which I'm calling an "option".

There are several
[transitions](https://github.com/josherick/zebralight-ui/blob/main/src/state_machine/implementations/basic_ui/enums.js#L80-L88)
related to button presses and timing. These are captured by React and fed into
the state machine to determine the next state, which is then rendered.

The state resulting from a transition is [defined](https://github.com/josherick/zebralight-ui/blob/main/src/state_machine/implementations/basic_ui/makeBasicUIStateMachine.js#L28) in a condensed way by breaking the state string into parts and swapping pieces out based on the transition, or drawing values from memory where necessary. Then at runtime, these are expanded into a full map of state => state pairs based on a transition.

State transitions are logged to the console for informational purposes.

# Why?
For fun!
